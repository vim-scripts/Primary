Primary is a Vim color scheme based on Google's colors. 

Primary contains settings for both light and dark backgrounds. It's is fun, very readable, and Google-inspired.

The Gui version uses the exact RGB codes from Google's logo. Primary on a 256-color terminal looks very similar and even 8-color terminals are supported.
